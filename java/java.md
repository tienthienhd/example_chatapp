# Gradle vs. Maven
## Gradle
- build automation system 
- open source
- uses the concepts on Apache Maven and Apache Ant
- uses domain-specific language based on the programming language Groovy
- uses XML for project configuration
- it also determines the order of tasks run by using a directed acyclic graph.
- it was designed to support multi-project builds that are expected to be quite huge.
- It also allows for incrementally adding to your build, because it knows which parts of your project are updated.
- based on a graph of task dependencies
## Maven
- project build automation using Java
- map out how a particular software is built: dequendencies
- uses an XML file to describe the project, dependencies of software
- predefined targets for tasks such as packaging and compiling.
